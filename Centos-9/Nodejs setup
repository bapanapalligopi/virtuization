To install Node.js on CentOS, follow the steps below:

### Step 1: Update Your System
First, update the package list to make sure your system is up to date:
```bash
sudo yum update -y
```

### Step 2: Install the Node.js Repository
There are two common ways to install Node.js on CentOS: using the NodeSource repository or using the default CentOS repository. The NodeSource repository is recommended because it provides the latest stable versions of Node.js.

#### Option 1: Using NodeSource Repository

1. **Add the NodeSource repository**:
   To install Node.js, use the NodeSource repository. The following command will add the repository for the latest Node.js version (you can replace `setup_16.x` with another version if needed, like `setup_18.x` for Node.js 18):
   ```bash
   curl -sL https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo bash -
   ```

2. **Install Node.js**:
   After adding the NodeSource repository, install Node.js with the following command:
   ```bash
   sudo yum install -y nodejs
   ```

#### Option 2: Using CentOS Default Repository
Node.js is available in CentOS's default repository, but it may not be the latest version.

1. **Install Node.js**:
   ```bash
   sudo yum install -y nodejs
   ```

### Step 3: Verify the Installation
Once the installation is complete, verify that Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) are installed correctly.

1. **Check Node.js version**:
   ```bash
   node -v
   ```

2. **Check npm version**:
   ```bash
   npm -v
   ```

This should output the version of Node.js and npm installed on your system.

### Step 4: Install Additional Development Tools (Optional)
If you want to build native modules from source (e.g., when installing some npm packages), you'll need development tools such as `gcc` and `make`. To install them, run:
```bash
sudo yum groupinstall "Development Tools" -y
```

### Conclusion
You have successfully installed Node.js on CentOS! You can now use Node.js and npm to develop JavaScript applications.
